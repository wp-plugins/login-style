Restyle your login page with custom CSS.

== Description ==

Login Style lets you restyle your login page with a custom CSS file.

Note: It hasn't been tested on versions earlier than 2.1, but may very well work.

== Installation ==

WordPress:

1. Unpack the plugin into `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Modify `login-style.css` to taste.

WordPress MU:

1. Unpack the plugin into `/wp-content/mu-plugins/`.
2. Make a symlink to `login-style.php` in the `mu-plugins` directory.
3. Modify `login-style.css` to taste.

You can tell if it's working straight away by checking for a cute little Easter Egg on the standard login page.
